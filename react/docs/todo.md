## Fix margins

One idea to fix margins is to use padding around the two main svgs, so that the svgs themselves are just 100 percent full width, and don't have any padding inside them.

# Backend errors

Get errors returning from backend for type errors and DB errors. Evaluate https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-errors.

✓ # Modify createEvent to populate event_category as well.

✓ 1. Check whether the category is a hashId or a new category. If new, create and then make the relation.
✓ 2. Make relations. See https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/wiki/Multi-select-field-populated-from-database-(using-esqueleto)
